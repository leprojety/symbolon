## Summary
The seminar, presented by Luis Kman, explores the "Geometry of Shared Consciousness in Conversation," proposing that conversation can be modeled using mathematical structures, specifically the complex plane, to represent the dynamic interplay of consciousness between individuals. The talk begins by questioning how shared consciousness arises despite the solitary nature of subjective experience. It introduces a framework where two conversants, labeled as "+1" and "−1," engage in a dialogue that mirrors the structure of complex numbers, with "I" and "−I" (square roots of negative unity) representing transitions in speech. The complex plane serves as a metaphor for conversational dynamics, where Euler’s formula and oscillations illustrate the fluid exchange between speakers. The discussion extends to category theory for multiple conversants and projective geometry to capture the unity and fluidity of shared consciousness. The talk concludes that conversation is not just an exchange of words but a structured geometry that connects self and other, revealing a relational, collective consciousness.

## Key Concepts
1. **Shared Consciousness in Conversation**: Conversation is a dynamic process where individual consciousnesses interact, creating a shared temporal and linguistic space despite the lack of direct access to another’s mind.
2. **Complex Plane as a Model**: The complex plane, with +1 and −1 as conversants and I and −I as transition points, models the structure of conversation. The unit circle and rotations (via Euler’s formula) represent the cyclical exchange of speech.
3. **Subjectivity and Temporality**: Consciousness is inherently temporal, shaped by memory and subjective time, which contrasts with objective clock time. Shared temporality emerges in conversation as individuals synchronize their subjective experiences.
4. **Iterants and Oscillations**: Iterants represent oscillations between +1 and −1, akin to the square root of negative unity, capturing the fluid, ambiguous nature of conversational roles.
5. **Category Theory**: Applied to model multiple conversants, category theory uses arrows to represent direct and indirect communication, forming a high-dimensional space of interactions.
6. **Projective Geometry and the Möbius Band**: Projective geometry, where infinities are identified, and the Möbius band, with its single-sided topology, illustrate the unity and fluidity of conversational roles, where distinctions like +1 and −1 merge.
7. **The Role of “I”**: The linguistic “I” is fluid, representing both a fixed self and a surveying perspective that unifies the conversational space, challenging the solitary subjective view.
8. **Collective Unconsciousness**: Shared activities like conversation or music reveal a pre-existing, unconsciously shared commonality, modeled as the origin (zero) in the complex plane or the PM (pre-distinction state).

## Glossary
- **Complex Plane**: A two-dimensional plane where each point is a complex number (a + bi), used here to model conversational dynamics with real (horizontal) and imaginary (vertical) axes.
- **Euler’s Formula**: A mathematical formula, e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i sin(θ), which describes points on the unit circle, used to represent the continuous rotation of conversational roles.
- **Iterant**: An ordered oscillation between states (e.g., +1 to −1), modeling the dynamic, time-sensitive nature of conversational exchange.
- **Möbius Band**: A topological surface with one side and one boundary, used to illustrate the unity of opposites (e.g., +1 and −1) in projective space.
- **Projective Geometry**: A geometry where parallel lines meet at infinity, used to model the unification of conversational roles and the fluid “I” in a shared space.
- **PM (Pre-distinction Marker)**: A conceptual state before distinctions like +1 and −1 emerge, representing the commonality from which conversation arises.
- **Square Root of Negative Unity**: Refers to i and −i, complex numbers where i^2 = −1, used to model the transition points in conversation.
- **Unit Circle**: A circle in the complex plane with radius 1, centered at the origin, where points represent conversational states and rotations.
