## **Glossary**  

#### **Dasein (Da-sein)**
* A German term meaning "being-there," used by Heidegger to refer to human existence. *Dasein* is unique in that it questions its own being and is always already in the world.  

#### **Being (Sein)**
* The central concept of Heidegger’s philosophy. He argues that Western metaphysics has forgotten the question of being, treating it as self-evident instead of deeply interrogating it.  

#### **Being-in-the-world (In-der-Welt-sein)**
* A fundamental structure of *Dasein*, emphasizing that human existence is always already embedded in a world of relationships, objects, and other beings.  

#### **Thrownness (Geworfenheit)**
* The idea that *Dasein* is "thrown" into existence without choosing its circumstances (such as birthplace, historical moment, or biological limitations).  

#### **Care (Sorge)**
* The fundamental structure of *Dasein*’s existence. Care refers to the way we are always concerned with our being, the future, and our possibilities.  

#### **Temporality (Zeitlichkeit)**
* The structure of *Dasein*’s existence as being fundamentally bound to time. Heidegger focuses on future-oriented temporality rather than memory-based past consciousness.  

#### **Authenticity (Eigentlichkeit)**
* A mode of existence where *Dasein* fully acknowledges its finitude and actively takes responsibility for its being.  

#### **Inauthenticity (Uneigentlichkeit)**
* A state in which *Dasein* is absorbed in everyday distractions and conforms to societal norms, avoiding the confrontation with its own mortality.  

#### **The They (Das Man)**
* The anonymous collective or impersonal social norms that dictate much of everyday life. *Dasein* often loses itself in *Das Man*, behaving as "one does" rather than choosing its own path.  

#### **Anxiety (Angst)**
* A fundamental mood in which *Dasein* becomes aware of the nothingness underlying existence and its own mortality. Unlike fear, which has a specific object, anxiety reveals the groundlessness of existence.  

#### **Being-toward-death (Sein-zum-Tode)**
* The idea that *Dasein* is always oriented toward its own death, which is its most certain and personal possibility. Acknowledging this allows for an authentic existence.  

#### **Guilt (Schuld)**
* Not moral guilt but an existential condition arising from the fact that *Dasein* always has unfulfilled possibilities and is responsible for its own being.  

#### **Understanding (Verstehen)**
* Not merely intellectual comprehension but an existential way of being in the world. *Dasein* always interprets its own existence in terms of possibilities.  

#### **Projection (Entwurf)**
* The way *Dasein* constantly projects itself into the future, shaping its possibilities and making meaning out of existence.  

#### **Thrown Projection (Geworfener Entwurf)**
* A combination of *thrownness* and *projection*, showing that *Dasein* is both determined by circumstances and free to shape its future.  

#### **Mood (Stimmung)**
* A pre-reflective way in which *Dasein* finds itself in the world. Moods reveal our fundamental relationship to existence before intellectual thought does.  

#### **World (Welt)**
* Not just the physical universe but the meaningful context in which *Dasein* exists and interprets its being.  

#### **Historicality (Geschichtlichkeit)**
* The idea that *Dasein* is not only shaped by its personal past but also by historical traditions and collective human experience.  

#### **Freedom toward Death (Freiheit zum Tode)**
* A paradoxical concept where true existential freedom is achieved by fully recognizing and accepting mortality.
