## 📘 Short Summary

This paper explores the current technological condition of humanity—exemplified by everything from zipper bags to artificial intelligence—through the Aristotelian concept of **entelechy** (the realization of potential or purpose). It frames the **Anthropocene**, our current epoch shaped by human influence on the Earth, as a consequence of **techne** (technical/artistic activity) being exercised without the corresponding virtue of **sophia** (wisdom). The central argument is that technology (techne) does not have a purpose (telos) in itself but is inherently for humans. However, the misalignment of human and planetary goals has led to ecological crisis. To remedy this, humans must rediscover wisdom and understand their role as part of—not above—Earth's ecosystem.

| Period / Milestone                     | Conceptual Event or Development                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ancient Greece (c. 4th century BCE)    | Aristotle defines **techne**, **telos**, **entelechy**, and classifies virtues of thought.       |
| Pre-Anthropocene (Holocene epoch)     | Human tool use increases, but Earth's systems remain self-regulating.                           |
| Mid-20th century                       | Beginning of the "Third Digital Revolution"; blurring of digital, physical, biological spheres. |
| 2002                                   | Paul Crutzen coins the term **Anthropocene** to describe human-driven geological change.        |
| 2010s                                  | Recognition of environmental collapse: sixth mass extinction, ecological degradation.           |
| Present & future                       | Philosophical inquiry into technology's **entelechy** is proposed as a remedy to this crisis.   |
