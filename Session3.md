# Symbolon #3 - Subjectivity (Self as Subject)

This document provides a summary, key concepts, and glossary based on the transcript of the third session of the Symbolon seminar series exploring philosophical concepts in the context of AI and human existence.

## Summary

The third session of the Symbolon seminar focuses on **subjectivity**, examining what it means to be a subject or self, particularly in the context of AI and consciousness debates. Presenter Hye Young Kim traces the historical evolution of the concept from Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" through Kant, Fichte, Hegel, and 20th-century phenomenology. The discussion explores three interrelated dimensions of subjectivity: the **subject-object relation**, **modes of self-awareness**, and **forms of the subject** (passive, active, and medial passive). Hye Young Kim challenges the traditional Cartesian model of the subject as autonomous, isolated, and transparent to itself, proposing instead a relational, layered, and recursive understanding of selfhood that unfolds through time, language, and relation to others. The seminar concludes by highlighting the contemporary relevance of these philosophical insights, particularly for understanding consciousness in AI and resisting reductive views of human existence. A key point emerged about how different languages encode different philosophies of selfhood, suggesting that the Western paradigm of subjectivity is not universal.

## Key Concepts Discussed

The following table summarizes the key concepts discussed in the seminar, providing a brief description for each.

| **Concept** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Historical Evolution of Subjectivity** | Traces the concept of the subject from Descartes' thinking self (isolated, autonomous), through Kant's transcendental unity of perception, Fichte's self-positing "I=I," and Hegel's social subject, to 20th-century phenomenology's emphasis on embodiment, narrative, and relationality. |
| **Subject-Object Relation** | The fundamental structure where consciousness is always directed toward something (intentionality). When perceiving objects, subjects tend to assimilate them into their understanding, potentially "colonizing" alterity. Some non-European languages challenge this binary structure. |
| **Modes of Self-Awareness** | Three distinct levels: **pre-reflective self-awareness** (immediate, non-thematic), **self-reflection** (thematic, objectifying self-relation), and **self-consciousness** (meta-awareness). Each reveals different aspects of subjectivity and self-relation. |
| **The Passive Subject** | The "minimal" or "thin" subject that is simply the experiential presence or "for-me-ness" of experience. This view (advocated by Galen Strawson) suggests subjectivity is nothing more than experientiality - momentary, pre-linguistic, and non-conceptual. |
| **The Active Subject** | The narrative self that constructs identity through time. This subject actively interprets experiences, organizes them into coherent sequences, and projects forward. Defined by narrative grasp and temporal continuity rather than momentary awareness. |
| **The Medial Passive Subject** | Derived from ancient Greek grammar's middle voice, this concept captures how subjects act while being acted upon. Unlike the Cartesian active subject or purely passive recipient, this subject acknowledges finite agency within constraints - acting within limits of biology, history, and relationality. |
| **Language and Subjectivity** | Different languages encode different understandings of selfhood. Examples from Malagasi (Madagascar) and Korean demonstrate how some languages don't follow the Indo-European subject-object structure, suggesting a more relational ontology of being. |
| **Infinite Regress Problem** | The paradox of self-reflection where each act of self-observation requires another observer, creating an endless chain. Various solutions include pre-reflective awareness, narrative unity, and linguistic minimalism. |

## Glossary

The following table provides definitions for key terms used in the seminar related to subjectivity and selfhood.

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|----------|----------------|
| **Subjectivity** | The quality of being a subject; consciousness characterized by having experiences from a first-person perspective. |
| **Cogito** | Descartes' famous formulation "I think, therefore I am" (cogito ergo sum), establishing the thinking self as foundation for knowledge. |
| **Transcendental Unity** | Kant's concept of a unifying structure that makes coherent experience possible by connecting perceptions across time. |
| **Intentionality** | The property of consciousness whereby it is always directed toward something; consciousness is always consciousness of something. |
| **Pre-reflective Self-awareness** | Immediate, non-objectifying awareness of oneself in experience without making oneself an object of attention. |
| **Self-reflection** | Taking oneself as an object of attention; thematically analyzing one's own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. |
| **Narrative Self** | Understanding identity as constituted through coherent storytelling about one's life, organizing experiences into meaningful sequences. |
| **Minimal Self** | The basic experiential presence or "for-me-ness" of experience; subjectivity reduced to momentary awareness without extended identity. |
| **Middle Voice** | A grammatical form where the subject performs an action that affects itself; between active and passive voice, suggesting a subject that acts while being acted upon. |
| **Alterity** | The quality of being other or different; often used in philosophical discussions about encountering genuine otherness. |
| **For-me-ness** | The quality of experience as being mine; the subjective character of consciousness. |
| **Cartesian Paradigm** | The philosophical framework stemming from Descartes that sees the subject as autonomous, isolated, transparent to itself, and distinct from the body. |

## Notes

- The seminar connects directly to contemporary discussions about AI consciousness, suggesting that understanding subjectivity is necessary for addressing whether machines can be conscious.
- Hye Young Kim challenges the dominance of the Cartesian model of subjectivity, which still influences how we think about consciousness in both humans and AI.
- The discovery that different languages encode different models of selfhood suggests the Western philosophical tradition's understanding of subjectivity is not universal.
- The concept of the medial passive subject offers a middle path between seeing humans as fully autonomous agents or as determined beings, acknowledging both freedom and constraint.
- These philosophical insights have practical implications for how we conceptualize identity in law, politics, science, and technology.
